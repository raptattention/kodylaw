Hello there!

My name is Kody Law, a Finance PhD student from Johnson School of Management at Cornell University. I specialize in the fields of fintech, financial intermediation, and entrepreneurship, all with a sharp focus on their impacts on everyday households.

My research work aims to explore and dissect the critical influences of groundbreaking trends in the finance industry. My objective is to shed light on the ways fintech and the ascendance of institutional investors are reshaping the financial landscape and how these changes directly impact the financial welfare of ordinary individuals.

In my research, I bring a multi-faceted approach that draws on both traditional financial theories and contemporary industry practices. This has allowed me to delve into complex and significant problems, providing actionable insights for the broader finance community. I am keen on fostering an informed understanding of the finance industry's current and future dynamics, helping to ensure that these developments lead to a more equitable and prosperous society.

I am currently on the job market and welcome your thoughts on employment opportunities or simply on finance.
